<h4>Simple Terminology Service (STS)</h4>

The STS is a front-end for browsing and using data model information stored in a Metamodel Database (MDB). Models are represented as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database#Labeled-property_graph">labeled property graphs</a>, having:
<ul>
  <li>Nodes (logical data groupings, similar to table rows),</li>
  <li>Relationships (logical associations between Nodes, similar to foreign key relationships between tables),</li>
  <li>Properties (data "slots" or "variables", similar to cells in a table column), along with</li>
  <li>Terms, which represent acceptable values and can be used across any Model.</li>
</ul>
Every entity in the database is accessible by an immutable ID, which is given in most detail views. An entity's metadata can be retrieved in JSON format via the API using this ID:
<pre>
  https://sts.ctos-data-team.org/v1/id/&lt;entity id&gt;
</pre>
A complete REST API is available and documented <a href="">in Swagger</a>.
<br>
